# Distributed File System
The intention of this project was to create a resource sharing network titled “EZShare” that could facilitate communication between client and server as well as server to server to fulfil various functions. The primary aims of the system were to:

* Setup point-to-point connections between servers as well as between client and server.

* Allow clients to publish, remove and share resources to a server.

* Allow clients to query the resource lists on the server to determine if any resources match the query.

* Allow clients to fetch locally saved files from the server that have been added to the resource list.

* Setup a system where servers can exchange their list of known servers to peers servers at a regular interval to expand and maintain the network.
